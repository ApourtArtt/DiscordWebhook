# DiscordWebhook

Simple Discord's webhook integration.
Coded in C++ and Qt.
Two functions are available :
- printMsg(QString msg) : it prints a simple message on your pre-configured webhook.
- printFullMsg(QByteArray json) : it allows you to use every possibilities of Discord's webhook. I recommand reading [https://gist.github.com/Birdie0/78ee79402a4301b1faf412ab5f1cdcf9](this).
